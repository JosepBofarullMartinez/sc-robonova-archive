Allegro license:

   Allegro is gift-ware. It was created by a number of people working in 
   cooperation, and is given to you freely as a gift. You may use, modify, 
   redistribute, and generally hack it about in any way you like, and you do 
   not have to give us anything in return. However, if you like this product 
   you are encouraged to thank us by making a return gift to the Allegro 
   community. This could be by writing an add-on package, providing a useful 
   bug report, making an improvement to the library, or perhaps just 
   releasing the sources of your program so that other people can learn from 
   them. If you redistribute parts of this code or make a game using it, it 
   would be nice if you mentioned Allegro somewhere in the credits, but you 
   are not required to do this. We trust you not to abuse our generosity.

tolua++ licence:

This is tolua++-1.0

* What is tolua++?
  tolua++ is an extension of toLua, a tool to integrate C/C++ code with
  Lua. tolua++ includes new features oriented to c++, such as class
  templates.

  tolua is a tool that greatly simplifies the integration of C/C++ code 
  with Lua. Based on a "cleaned" header file, tolua automatically generates 
  the binding code to access C/C++ features from Lua. Using Lua-5.0 API and
  metamethod facilities, the current version automatically maps C/C++ 
  constants, external variables, functions, namespace, classes, and methods 
  to Lua. It also provides facilities to create Lua modules.

* Availability
  tolua is freely available; you can redistribute it and/or modify it.
  The software provided hereunder is on an "as is" basis, and
  the author has no obligation to provide maintenance, support, 
  updates, enhancements, or modifications.

  tolua can be downloaded from the sites below:
            http://www.codenix.com/~tolua/
            http://www.codenix.com/~tolua/tolua++-1.0.tar.bz2

* Installation
  See INSTALL.

* Contacting the author
  tolua has been designed and implemented by Waldemar Celes.
  tolua++ is maintained by Ariel Manzur.
