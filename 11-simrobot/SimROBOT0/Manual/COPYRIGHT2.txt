Some further comments:

Every effort has been made to ensure that Festival does not contain
any violation of intellectual property rights through disclosure of
trade secrets, copyright or patent violation.  Considerable time and
effort has been spent to ensure that this is the case.  However,
especially with patent problems, it is not always within our control
to know what has or has not been restricted.  If you do suspect that
some part of Festival cannot be legally distributed please inform us
so that an alternative may be sought.  Festival is only useful if it
is truly free to distribute.

As of 1.4.0 the core distribution (and speech tools) is free.  Unlike
previous versions which had a commercial restriction.  You are free to
incorporate Festival in commercial (and of course non-commercial
systems), without any further communication or licence from us.
However if you are seriously using Festival within a commercial
application we would like to know, both so we know we are contributing
and so we can keep you informed of future developments.  Also if you
require maintenance, support or wish us to provide consultancy feel
free to contact us.

The voices however aren't all free.  At present the US voices, kal and
ked are free. Our British voices are free themselves but they use OALD
which is restricted for non-commercial use.  Our Spanish voice is also
so restricted.

Note other modules that festival supports e.g MBROLA and OGI
extensions, may have different licencing please take care when using
the system to understand what you are actually using.
